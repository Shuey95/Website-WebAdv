  <h1>Overview</h1>
  

<p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. There characterics include; large trunks, flabby ears; and strong, thick legs. There are two species of elephant. The Asian elephant and the African elephant; both live on separate continents and have many unique features.</p>

<h1><strong>Elephas Maximuse Indicus</strong></h1>

<img src="images/AsianEle.png" alt=""width="400" height="350"/>

  <li>EARS: Small, rounded ear</li>
  <li>TRUNK TIP: One “finger” for grasping</li>
  <li>HEAD: Twin dome</li>
  <li>HEIGHT: 6.5-9’</li>
  <li>WEIGHT: 6,600-13,200 lbs.</li>

 
<p> The Asian elephant once roamed from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in western Asia as far east as China's Yangtze River. No longer. Now a highly endangered species, it has been eliminated from western Asia completely, from substantial parts of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, and almost entirely from China.
 Exceedingly adaptable in diet and behavior, elephants can survive anywhere from grasslands to rain forests, but they must migrate across large areas to find water and suitable food at different times of the year. Such vast ranges have become extremely rare in densely populated, rapidly developing Asia.</p>

<p>It's estimated that the wild Asian population, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands at the turn of the 20th century, is now only 37,000 to 48,000. But thankfully to the traditional ancient culturs of many countries where Elephants are valued; about 16,000 Asian elephants are kept in captivity in 11 different Asian countries. In Thailand there are nearly three times as many elephants in domesticity as in the wild.</p>

<h2><strong>Loxodonta Africana</strong></h2>

<img src="images/AfricanEle.png" alt="" width="384" height="272"/>

<li>EARS: Large, “African-shaped” ear</li>
<li>TRUNK TIP: Two “finger” for grasping</li>
<li>HEAD: Single dome</li>
<li>HEIGHT: 9-13'</li>
<li>WEIGHT: 8,800-15,400 lbs</li>
<p>he African elephant is sway-backed and has a tapering head, while the Asian elephant is hump-backed and has a huge, domed head. Probably the most interesting difference between the two species is their ears. Oddly, the African elephant’s large ears match the shape of the African continent, and the Asian elephant’s smaller ears match the shape of India.</p>
  
 <p> Most African elephants live on the savanna, but some live in forests or even deserts. Most Asian elephants live in forests. As herbivores (plant eaters), elephants consume grass, foliage, fruit, branches, twigs, and tree bark. Elephants spend three-quarters of its day eating, and they eats as much as 400 pounds (880 kg) of vegetation each day. For this task, they have only four teeth for chewing.
  The African elephant once roamed the entire continent of Africa, and the Asian elephant ranged from Syria to northern China and the islands of Indonesia. These abundant populations have been reduced to groups in scattered areas south of the Sahara and in isolated patches in India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.</p>
  
  <p>Demand for ivory, combined with habitat loss from human settlement, has led to a dramatic decline in elephant populations in the last few decades. In 1930, there were between 5 and 10 million African elephants. By 1979, there were 1.3 million.</p>
  
  <p>
  In 1989, when they were added to the international list of the most endangered species, there were about 600,000 remaining, less than one percent of their original number.
  Asian elephants were never as abundant as their African cousins, and today they are even more endangered than African elephants. At the turn of the century, there were an estimated 200,000 Asian elephants. Today there are probably no more than 35,000 to 40,000 left in the wild.:</p>

<h1><strong>Poaching</strong></h1>

<p>
Illegal poaching and trade of endangered animals has been a huge issue in Africa for many years. Even today, despite great efforts by African wildlife authorities and environmental groups, the killing goes on. Earlier this year, over 1,200 tusks were discovered in Tanzania, a sign that the situation is still nowhere near where it should be. It is therefore understandable that conservation groups such as IFAW should be outraged at the recent proposals being put forward by governments for a limited legal trade in certain animal products. However, as is so often the case, the argument is a complicated one, and it's difficult to judge what is best. The two most poignant cases concern the elephant and the rhino, both species that were severely threatened during the poaching era of the 1980s.The elephant population of South Africa has grown steadily thanks to the great efforts employed by conservation groups and wildlife authorities in Africa. Nevertheless massive numbers of elephants are killed every year illegally to feed the ever-hungry black market in ivory.</p>

<p>Recently the South African government made a proposal concerning the sale of ivory and elephant hides stockpiled by their national parks through natural mortality and problem animal control. The money from these sales would be put back into their parks and would help fund activities such as elephant management programmes, control of illegal hunting of elephants, and creating more and larger protected areas for the elephants to be re-established in. The items sold would come from legitimate sources - materials seized from illegal traders would not be included in the trades. The proponents of this proposal claim it would provide a sustainable way of maintaining the conservation efforts of the African elephant.</p>

<p>Conservationists take a different view. They warn that opening up a legal ivory trade would encourage 'the proliferation of illegal activities such as poaching, and thus associated illegal markets.' They reason that creating a legal ivory market would serve only to support the growth of current markets in poached ivory. This would undermine the efforts that the governments are attempting to support through the proposed legal market. Instead, the groups suggest that the governments invest in creating a healthy eco-tourism industry, which would benefit everyone, both financially and ecologically.
