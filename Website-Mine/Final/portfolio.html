  <h1>Why They Matter</h1>
  <p>
  
Itâ€™s very fair to question why elephants matter in a world packed by poverty, war and extreme environmental change. The reason being is that, elephants play a crucial niche in their ecosystem. The ecosystem shared by Elephants and  several other species is constantly structured by the role the large animal plays in it's environment. According to the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF), In tropical forests, elephants create clearings and gaps in the canopy that encourage tree regeneration. In the savannas, they reduce bush cover to create an environment. Elephants assist in maintaining a diverse ecosystem that other organisms largely depend on.</p>

<p>Elephants play an essential rose in seed dispersion. WWF states that, The seeds of many plant species are dependent on passing through an elephant's digestive tract before they can germinate. It is calculated that at least a third of tree species in central African forests rely on elephants in this way for distribution of seeds. Large seeds that are not consumable by smaller species are distributed by Elephants throughout their environment. If the larger seeds were not to be dispersed over large distances through the elephant, this would directly alter the nature structure of the ecosystem; an altered ecosystem would impact both humans and species that inhabit it. </p>

<p>Local people too depend on elephants. Elephants have become a cultural icon for both India and Africa. For many others worldwide, elephants have become a large tourist attraction. Ecotourism brings in profit and income to many local communities.</p>

<p>By protecting this endangered species, we are committed to protecting the very ecosystem we and many other species depend on. </p>
